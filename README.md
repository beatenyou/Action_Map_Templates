# Action_Map_Templates
These templates help red team leads create Action Maps and MITRE ATT&CK narratives for hot washes and assessment reports. Simply download the templates and import them into https://draw.io. While I have mixed feelings about Visio, these templates make it much easier to create clear visuals for red team assessments.
